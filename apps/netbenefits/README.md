# Fidelity NetBenefits statement downloader

Makes and saves your own **quarterly statements** (or monthly ones) from
Fidelity NetBenefits, the workplace-plan site for a 401(k) and the like,
as PDFs, for your records. Read-only, delete-safe, and part of
[PaperPull](../../README.md).

Mapped and run against a real account on 2026-09-19. Thirty-nine quarterly
statements back to the plan's first quarter in 2016, every one valid, and
a second run downloaded nothing.

**Several employers and plans.** One owner's sign-in with two employers and
four plans was surveyed read-only on 2026-10-14, and the app was changed to
handle it (below). That change then ran live on the same sign-in the same
day. Discover listed the four plans with 39 quarters each, and Pilot plus
Run All saved 39 combined ABC statements and 39 North-Star Medical Group
statements, every PDF naming the plans its label says, with nothing sent
to manual review. The names here are invented. The checks added in review
after that run, described below, have not run live yet.

## How it reads the site

NetBenefits keeps no archive of statements. Its Statements page is a
generator, you pick a month, a quarter, year to date or a custom range and
it builds the statement on the spot as a web page, and its "Download or
Print This Statement" button is the browser's print. So there is no list to
read, and nothing on the page is clicked. This app makes the statement for
each completed period itself, through the same form request the page sends
(the site's transaction token is fetched and used inside the page, and
never enters this program), and renders the result to PDF the way the print
button would, with the site's own stylesheet and logo.

Discovery walks completed periods newest first, back to the oldest year the
page's own picker offers, and stops at the first period the site refuses
after a real statement, since a plan has one start date. A run scoped with
`--year` or `--start-date` makes only the years it wants. Each statement is
identified by its kind and period end date. The plan's name goes in the
filename, the plan number never does.

**A sign-in with several plans.** NetBenefits remembers the plan you last
looked at, and its Statements page then shows that plan straight away, so
the app reads the plan list from the site's "Choose a Plan" page first,
which lists every plan on the sign-in by name, each linking to its own
Statements page. The page is read only once the tab is on the statements
site itself, and only links of the exact shape a plan's Statements address
has count as plans. Two or more of them make a sign-in with several plans.
A sign-in it lists exactly one plan for, with no other link naming a plan,
goes on exactly as before, with the same records and file names, and any
plan list kept from before is let go. One such link beside other links
that name a plan cannot be told either way, so the run stops, says so and
keeps no plan list. When there is no such page, the "Select Account" page
the Statements address shows when no plan is remembered is read instead.
Nothing on either page is pressed, and the employer chooser, whose
Continue changes a saved preference, is never used.

For each plan the app asks for the plan's address from inside the page, a
request the browser will not follow to another site. If the Statements
page then shows that plan, by a heading that starts with the plan's name
and its number, the plan is open, and if not it is left for you. The tab
never opens a plan's own address. A statement is made only while the page
shows the plan it is filed under, and it is filed under the plan's name
from the list, as in
`2026-06-30 NetBenefits Quarterly Statement - ABC 457(b) Plan.pdf`, never
under the employer the statement's own header names. A plan whose address
sends you elsewhere (on the surveyed sign-in, one plan's went to the
Fidelity retail sign-in) is left for you to open yourself, counted as
needing review, and never followed. If the session is gone when a later
plan is asked for, the run stops and keeps what it saved. A request the
browser refuses while the session is still signed in fails that one
statement, as it always did. Records are kept by a digest of the plan,
never its numbers, and the plan list is kept in `plans.json` beside the
progress file so a later run can find the plans even when neither list
page shows. If it cannot, it says so and asks you to sign out and in, then
Discover, then Resume.

A sign-in with one plan that gains another keeps what it saved. A quarter
of a plan counts as done when a statement of that quarter was saved before
under the plan's own name, and is not made again. A statement listed
before the sign-in had several plans and never saved is not made, since
which plan it belongs to cannot be told, and is left for review, while
Discover lists each plan's own.

**Combined statements.** NetBenefits makes one combined statement for the
plans of one employer, and asking for it from any of those plans gives the
same statement. After each statement is saved, the app reads its text. It
must name the plan it was made for, or it is set aside for review as the
wrong document. Some plans' statements print a line naming the employer and
then a title of the plan's type, as in `457b Deferred Compensation Plan
Retirement Savings Statement`, and never the name Choose a Plan gives the
plan. Such a statement counts as naming its plan only when all of these
hold. The plan's name on the list gives one type, such as 457(b). The
site's header named one employer on the pages that showed the plan during
the run. Every Retirement Savings Statement title in the text is of that
type, and one comes right after that employer's name. The text names no
other plan of the list, and gives no type of a plan that may be at the same
employer, as a combined statement would. No other employer on the sign-in
has a name this employer's name ends with, since once a statement's line
breaks are gone the two cannot be told apart. And every other plan on the
sign-in is of another type, or the header named another employer on its
own page. A plan whose name gives no type, and which nothing places at
another employer, may be of the same type at the same employer, and then
the statement is set aside as before. A plan whose page never names an
employer (one whose page never opens, say) can be placed by its employer's
combined statement. That statement must name it and the plan it was made
for, the header must have named one employer on that plan's pages during
the run, and the statement must carry that employer's name and no other
employer's name the header named during the run. A combined statement
saved by an earlier run is read again for this, and counts only while the
header names the same employer for its plan as when it was made. A
statement that waits only on such a plan is held in Manual Review, judged
again where it waits at the end of each run that shows its plan, filed
once something places that plan, and set aside as soon as it can be told
it is not the plan's. It is never filed without that check, however a run
ends. So a
second plan of the same type at the same employer, the employer's combined
statement and another employer's statement of that type are all still set
aside. When a statement names other plans of the list too, it is saved
under the employer's name when the site's header gives one and the
statement carries it too (`... Quarterly Statement - Lakeside College of
Arts Plans.pdf`), or else under the plans' names (`... Quarterly Statement
- ABC 403(b), ABC 457(b) and ABC DCP Plans.pdf`). A name in the text only
says which plans a statement may cover, since a plan's name can be a few
common words. Each of those plans still asks for its own statement, and
when that is the very same statement, by the digest of its text, it is
recorded as covered by the file already saved and not kept twice. A
statement for one plan is filed under that plan as above.

`statement_period` in `config.json` is `quarterly` by default, the cadence
a plan issues on paper. Set it to `monthly` for one per month instead.

**One quirk, handled.** NetBenefits times a session out on page activity,
not on requests, so a run that only fetches gets signed out after a few
minutes, and the site also moves its own tab around on occasion. The app
reloads the Statements page every minute during a run, and if the tab is
moved mid-call it goes back and asks once more.

## Sign-in

Sign-in uses your own installed Edge or Chrome in a separate profile, on
`nb.fidelity.com`. You sign in yourself, answer your own two-factor prompt,
and leave the window open. The app never sees your password. If you also
use the `fidelity` app, that is a separate sign-in, since the two sites are
separate.

## Safety

This is a retirement account. The site can change contributions, move
money between investments, take a loan or a withdrawal, and change
beneficiaries. This app never activates a control that does any of those.
The only request it sends is the statement request the page itself sends,
and it refuses to send it from any page that is not on
`workplaceservices.fidelity.com`. An expired session stops the run rather
than reporting an empty success.
