"""ALL Fidelity NetBenefits selectors, URLs, and page behavior live here.

When NetBenefits changes, repair this file only.

STATUS, mapped 2026-09-18 against a signed-in session.

  NetBenefits is Fidelity's workplace-plan site (401(k) and the like) at
  workplaceservices.fidelity.com, signed in through nb.fidelity.com. It
  keeps no archive of issued statements. Its Statements page is a
  generator, pick a month, a quarter, year to date or a custom range and
  it builds the statement on the spot, as a web page with a "Download or
  Print This Statement" button that is window.print(). So there is no list
  to read. This app makes the statement for each completed period itself
  and renders the page to PDF, the way the print button would.

  THE CALLS, from inside the signed-in page, cookie session:
    * token   GET  /mybenefits/employerservices/api/txntoken
                   -> {txnTokenValue, success}. Fetched and used inside one
                   page.evaluate, so it never enters this process.
    * make    POST /mybenefits/savings2/sod/soddetail, form-encoded
                   txntoken, sodReqIndicator=HACK, dateRange=MM/DD/YYYY-MM/DD/YYYY,
                   ytdDateRange, sodPreview=N, consentReq=N
                   -> the statement page (title "... Statement Details"),
                      or an error page (title "... Online Statement error
                      page") for a period before the account existed.
  The statement HTML is rendered to PDF in a temporary tab of the same
  browser with <base href> on workplaceservices.fidelity.com so its
  stylesheet and logo load. Nothing on the page is clicked.

  PERIODS. Quarterly by default, monthly with statement_period in the
  config. Only completed periods, newest first, back to the first year the
  site's own picker offers (2016). Discovery makes each statement to learn
  whether the period exists, and stops walking older periods at the first
  error page that follows a real statement, since a plan has one start.
  A scoped run makes only the years it wants.

  IDENTITY is period kind + period end date + plan name. The page's own
  plan number is not part of any filename.

  SEVERAL PLANS, surveyed read-only 2026-10-14 on a login with two
  employers and four plans, and read live once since. The site remembers
  the plan last chosen, and the Statements address then shows that plan's
  Statements page at once, so that address cannot tell a login with one
  plan from one with several. The "Choose a Plan" page,
  /mybenefits/definedcontributions/navigation/dc/OnlineStatement?planChooser=yes,
  lists every plan whatever is remembered, as plain links whose text is
  the plan's name and whose address is that plan's Statements address
  (OnlineStatement?plan=<digits>&). It is read first, and only once the
  tab is on a signed-in page of the statements site. A login it shows two
  or more such addresses for is a login with several plans. One it shows
  exactly one for, and no other link carrying a plan, goes on exactly as
  a login with one plan always did. One such address beside other links
  carrying a plan cannot be told either way, so the run stops and says
  so, and writes no list of plans. With no such address, the Statements
  address shows a "Select Account" page when no plan is remembered, a
  select named accountSelect whose options carry the same addresses with
  the client too, and that is read instead. Its Go button is never
  pressed. The plan's name comes from that list and from nowhere else.
  The statement's own header names whichever employer the site
  remembers, so it is never used as the plan's name.

  A plan is chosen by asking for its address from inside the page, a
  same-origin request that the browser refuses to follow to any other
  host. If the Statements page then shows that plan, by its form and a
  heading naming the plan and its number in brackets, the plan is open,
  and if not it is left for the owner. The tab never loads a plan's own
  address, since a redirect hop cannot be refused there. A statement is
  made only while the tab shows the plan it is filed under. One plan on
  the surveyed login sent its address to the Fidelity retail sign-in on
  digital.fidelity.com, so a plan whose address leaves this host is left
  for the owner and never followed. The employer chooser and its
  Continue, which change a saved preference, are never used.

SAFETY (this is a retirement account):
  Strictly READ-ONLY. NetBenefits can change contributions, move money
  between investments, take a loan or a withdrawal, and change
  beneficiaries. This app must NEVER activate a control that does any of
  those, never submits a form other than the statement request above,
  never confirms a dialog, and never accepts terms on the user's behalf.
  An expired session raises SessionExpired so a run stops loudly rather
  than reporting an empty success.
