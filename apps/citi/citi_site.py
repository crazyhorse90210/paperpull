"""ALL citi.com selectors, URLs, and page behavior live here.

When Citi changes its site, repair this file only.

STATUS: mapped 2026-09-20 against a signed-in session and verified end to
end (accounts, list, PDF).

HOW THE SITE WORKS
  Citi Online is an Angular app on online.citi.com. Sign-in lands on the
  dashboard. The Account Statements page is /US/nga/accstatement, and it
  is fed by a JSON API the page calls itself. This app makes the same
  calls from inside the signed-in page, so the session never leaves the
  browser and nothing on the page is clicked.

  All four are POST with a JSON body, cookie session, plus the page's own
  app identity headers (APP_HEADERS below, the same for every customer):
    accounts  .../accounts/statementsAndLetters/eligibleAccounts/retrieve
              body {transactionCode: "1079_statements"}
              -> eligibleAccounts.cardAccounts[] of {accountId (an opaque
                 uuid), accountNickname "Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi
                 - 1234", accountType "CARDS"}
    list      .../card/accounts/statements/accountsAndStatements/retrieve
              body {accountId}
              -> statementsByYear[] of {displayYearTitle,
                 statementsByMonth[] of {statementDate "MM/DD/YYYY"}},
                 accountOpenDate, archivedStatementsEligibleFlag.
                 The site lists roughly the last two years online.
    pdf       .../card/accounts/statements/recent/retrieve
              body {accountId, statementDate "MM/DD/YYYY",
                    requestType "RECENT STATEMENTS"}
              -> application/pdf, the statement itself.
    requested .../card/accounts/statements/archiveStatements/retrieve
              body {accountId}
              -> archivedStatementRequestStartDate "MM/DD/YYYY",
                 archivedStatementsByMonth[] of {displayDate "Oct 2020",
                 statementDate "202010" (the month alone, no day),
                 statusIndicator "F" for ready, documentExpiryDate
                 "20201204", documentExpirationDateText "Dec, 04"}.
              The same pdf call takes one of them with requestType
              "ARCHIVED STATEMENTS" and the month exactly as listed
              (measured 2026-10-17, #103).

  IDENTITY is the card plus the statement date. There is no document id.
  A requested statement is the card plus its month, dated the month's
  last day, under a title without a day, so its key never meets a
  regular statement's.

REQUESTED STATEMENTS (#103)
  Statements older than what the site lists online sit behind "Request
  Older Statements". The holder asks for them on Citi, and Citi then
  lists them as Requested Statements for a limited time. This app never
  submits that request (it is an account action, and the guard refuses
  "request" as a verb), it only takes what is already listed while it is
  listed. The requested call has twice answered 200 with no start date
  and an empty list while the page showed three, so an answer without
  archivedStatementRequestStartDate is a list NOT read, never "none
  requested".

NOT COVERED
  The Annual Account Summary is a web page, not a PDF, and is left
  alone. Tax forms are not offered for a credit card.

SAFETY (this is a credit card account that can move money):
  Strictly READ-ONLY. This module makes the four calls above and nothing
  else. It never activates a control that pays, transfers, requests a
  credit line change, adds an authorized user, locks or replaces a card,
  redeems points, or edits any setting, and it clicks nothing at all.
  FORBIDDEN_CONTROL_RE and SAFE_DOC_CONTROL_RE are kept so the repo-wide
  guard tests cover this app the same as every other, and --diagnose uses
  them to grade the page's controls.
