"""Text a spreadsheet tool writes stays text, never a formula.

The two spreadsheet tools, tools/export_purchases.py and
tools/export_transactions.py, write out words other people chose. A
marketplace seller names the item on an Amazon receipt and a merchant
names itself on a card statement. A spreadsheet takes a cell that starts
with = as a formula, and Excel takes one starting with +, - or @ the
same way. So an item named =1+1 became a formula in the workbook, and the
CSV kept it for the spreadsheet to work out on opening. A formula can do
more than add. HYPERLINK and WEBSERVICE reach an address, and the cells a
formula names go along with it.

Every value either tool writes goes through here on its way into a cell,
and so does every value the apps write to their own CSV files and read
back from them (THE APPS' OWN CSV FILES, below).

    from paperpull_core.sheets import csv_value, keep_text, xlsx_value

    writer.writerow({k: csv_value(v) for k, v in row.items()})
    ws.append([xlsx_value(v) for v in values])
    for row in ws.iter_rows():
        for cell in row:
            keep_text(cell)

Only text is touched. An amount, a quantity or a count is a number before
it gets here and is written as one, so -12.34 in an Amount column stays
the number it was. Text is told apart by its type, not by a list of
columns, so a column added later is covered without anyone naming it.

WHAT EXCEL DOES (measured 2026-10-16, Excel for Microsoft 365 on Windows)

    a CSV       =1+1, -1+1 and @SUM(1,1) opened as formulas.
                -12.34 and -1,234.56 opened as numbers, with no formula.
                -$12.34, -$1,234.56 and -€12.34 opened as numbers and
                -£12.34 as text, none of them as a formula. -$A$1, -$B2,
                -kr12.34 and -zł12.34 opened as formulas.
                =1+1 after a space or a tab opened as text.
                '=1+1 and ''=1+1 opened as text, with the quotes shown in
                the cell.
    an xlsx     A string cell holding =1+1 opened as text. Edited and
                entered again it became a formula, unless the cell carried
                the quote prefix.

So a CSV value that starts like a formula gets a single quote in front,
OWASP's form for CSV injection. Excel shows that quote, so it goes only
where it is needed. An xlsx text value is always a string cell, which a
spreadsheet does not work out on opening, and one that starts like a
formula also carries the quote prefix, the mark Excel itself leaves when a
person types a leading quote, so editing the cell keeps it text as well.
The quote prefix leaves the xlsx value as it was.

A value with spaces in front is quoted too when the first thing after them
starts a formula, for a spreadsheet set to trim a cell before reading it,
as LibreOffice can be. A full-width sign counts as the sign it stands for,
＝ as =, which OWASP names for Japanese settings. A NUL character counts
for nothing, since Excel drops it from a CSV it opens, and =1+1 behind one
opened as a working formula.

A CSV can also be split where its writer did not split it. Excel in a
country whose list separator is ; reads a comma CSV opened from its file
by that separator, so every ; inside a value starts a new cell, and a line
break inside a quoted value starts a new row. A quote at the start of the
whole value does nothing for what follows one of those, so a piece after a
; or a line break that starts like a formula gets a quote of its own.
A double click in a ; country was not measured here, since this Excel's
separator is a comma. Excel's own import set to split at ; did split that
way, and it read ""=1+1 at the start of a piece, which is how the csv
module writes "=1+1 inside a quoted value, as an empty quoted part with
=1+1 after it, a working formula. So a piece is also quoted when it starts
with a sign once blank space and quotes of either kind in front of it are
set aside.

A plain negative number written as text, -12.34 or -1,234.56, is left
alone, and so is one with a $, £ or € between the minus and the digits,
the way the apps write a refund, -$12.34. Excel reads it as that number,
or as plain text, and nothing more, the way it reads 12.34 beside it, and
a quote would only show in the cell. Anything else after the minus, -1+1,
-$A$1 or -kr12.34 for three, is quoted.

A piece after a ; or a line break that is a plain negative number is
quoted all the same. Where the list separator is ; the decimal sign is a
comma, and the last piece of a value the csv module leaves unquoted runs
on through the comma that ends it into the next value, so -1 beside 5+1
is read as -1,5+1, a working formula there. That was found by modeling
such a reader, not measured, and no real value had such a piece.

WHAT AN XLSX CELL CANNOT HOLD (measured 2026-10-16, openpyxl 3.1.5 and the
same Excel)

An xlsx is written in XML 1.0, which has no way to hold a control
character other than tab, line feed and carriage return, nor U+FFFE,
U+FFFF or a surrogate. openpyxl refuses a value holding one of those 29
control characters (IllegalCharacterError) as the row goes in, before any
cell exists to sweep, so one item name with a NUL in it from a provider's
JSON stopped the whole export. U+FFFE, U+FFFF and a lone surrogate it
writes anyway, and Excel then would not open the workbook at all. So
xlsx_value takes every one of those characters out on the way into a
cell, once each surrogate has been made whole (HALF OF A CHARACTER,
below), which leaves none.

The rest are dropped, not replaced with a mark. None of them prints, so
the text reads as it did on the provider's page, where a mark like U+FFFD
would show a character the page never had. Excel itself drops a NUL from
a CSV it opens, and its CLEAN function, made for tidying text brought in
from elsewhere, removes all of the first 32 codes. Kept by Excel's own
escape instead, a NUL came back from the xlsx and cut the cell short at
that point when it was edited. From a CSV Excel kept the other 28 in the
cell and read none of them as the start of a formula, so a CSV keeps
them.

Six of the control characters stand between words, the vertical tab
Word uses for a line break, the form feed and the four separators from
0x1C to 0x1F. Python counts them as blank space, and Uber's clean() and
the transactions tool's reading of a statement both turn each into a
space. Dropped, Kettle and a vertical tab and Lid would read KettleLid,
so each of those six becomes a space instead.

Excel also reads _x and four hex digits and _ in an xlsx string as its
escape for one character, _x003D_ as =, and openpyxl writes such text as
it is. So _x003D_1+1 opened as =1+1, with no quote prefix since the text
keep_text tested did not start like a formula, and an edit made it a
working formula. xlsx_value writes the _ in front of such a run as
_x005F_, the escape for _ itself, and Excel shows the text as it came.
That comes after the drop, since dropping a character from inside such a
run joins it up, and Excel would then read it. A space never makes one.

HALF OF A CHARACTER (measured 2026-10-16, Playwright's Chromium 153 and
pdfplumber 0.11.10)

JavaScript holds text as UTF-16, where a character past U+FFFF, most often
an emoji, is two halves called a surrogate pair. A string cut between the
two keeps one half, JSON writes that half as an escape, and Python's json
module reads it back as the half itself. pdfplumber gave one too, for a
PDF whose font maps a character to the number 55357 in a ToUnicode range.
UTF-8 has no way to write half a character, so every CSV writer here
stopped at one with UnicodeEncodeError, both tools' exports and an app's
own CsvFile alike, and openpyxl wrote one into a workbook Excel would not
open.

The browser had already settled what a half is. Chromium showed a lone
half as U+FFFD, the replacement character, printed U+FFFD into the PDF it
made of the page, and gave Python U+FFFD for it from evaluate, from the
page's text, from an in-page fetch and from the DevTools protocol itself.
JavaScript's own toWellFormed gives the same. Only text Python read for
itself carried the half, a provider's JSON through the json module and a
statement's text through pdfplumber.

So whole_characters, which every writer here runs first, makes each lone
half U+FFFD, the way the page showed it and the PDF beside the row prints
it, and the same words read from the page and from the provider's JSON
come out the same. Two halves side by side, high then low, are joined into
the character they make, as the browser shows them. A half is replaced,
not dropped. Unicode's security report (UTR #36, 3.1.2) warns that
deleting what cannot be read joins the text on either side into something
no check before it saw, and U+FFFD starts no formula and joins nothing. A
value with no half in it is written exactly as before. Counted again for
this on 2026-10-16, the real installs held no half and no U+FFFD among
179,703 values in 52 order histories and indexes found outside Backups
folders, 2,644 PDF names and 2,368 cached descriptions.

An app run gets past a half as well. Every app makes a provider's text
whole where it reads it, and progress.json, file names and every check
that compares them with these files keep it the same way (characters.py).

THE APPS' OWN CSV FILES

Every app keeps its record as CSV files beside the PDFs, the order
history, the receipt index and the document index, written and read back
through core storage's CsvFile. They hold the same words other people
chose, are written for Excel to open on a double click, and are read back
by the app itself, by Rename and by both tools here. So the quote goes in
by the same rule on the way in and comes off on every way out, and it
must come off only where it was put, since a name can really start with a
quote.

    store_value(v)    for every value written to one of these files
    read_stored(t)    for every value read from one, read_stored_row(r)
                      for a whole row from csv.DictReader

store_value quotes the whole value and each piece after a ; or a line
break by the test a piece gets above, which sets aside the quotes already
in front. read_stored takes one quote off a piece, and then off the whole
value, only where that test passes, and a quote in front never changes
its answer. So '=1+1 as a real name is written ''=1+1 and read
back as '=1+1, =1+1 is written '=1+1 and read back as =1+1, and every
value reads back exactly as it was written. A value holding half a
character reads back as whole_characters made it, since no file can hold
the half.

That test is part of the files' format. read_stored takes a quote off only
where today's test would put one, so a test that quotes less than an
earlier one leaves the earlier version's quotes showing for good, and a
file name carrying one no longer matches its file. So the test may grow
and never shrink. Growing it changes how an older file reads only where a
value starts with a quote and then what the test newly covers. The STORED
examples in core/tests/test_sheets.py hold the format.

A file written before this rule reads as it did, value for value, unless
a value in it starts with a quote and then text like a formula, or holds
such a piece after a ; or a line break. On 2026-10-16 the real installs
had none of those among 180,418 values in 55 files, and no value starting
with a quote at all.
