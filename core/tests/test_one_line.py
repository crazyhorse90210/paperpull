"""A name from the disk never starts a line of its own in what a run says.

Linux and macOS take a line break in a file or folder name, and a JSON
setting can hold one. The control panel reads a run's output line by line,
taking its counts from the line the run marks for it, and the page reads
the panel's stream line by line. So a config named config.<line break>...,
or a folder holding one, could print a line the run never wrote.

Three things keep that from happening, and each is held here. load_config
refuses a config whose path or named settings cannot be shown on one line
(every path an app prints is built from those and from names it made
itself). The run's result line carries the mark the panel gave it, which
nothing else prints. And the export tool prints the names it found as one
line each, with its own marked line for the panel."""
