"""Every app checks a document against each kind of rival apart.

identity.distinguish asks which of several listed documents a saved PDF
names best, and it counts only the facts no rival shares. Handed one pool
holding two kinds of rival, that rule takes everything away. Another
account's statement of the same day differs by its account and shares the
day. The account's own statement of another day differs by its day and
shares the account. Pooled, the day goes because the first shares it and
the account goes because the second does, so nothing of the statement is
left to count. A wrong statement is then filed unchecked, or verified on
some fact no rival carries at all, which says nothing about which
statement it is. Bank of America's first build did this and a fresh
review caught it (#121). Navy Federal had done it since the check was
built, and on the sixteen of its owner's sixty four statements that share
a day with the other account's, the check was never made.

So an app whose identities carry more than one fact checks against each
kind apart, as Bank of America's download_one does. It hands delivery the
documents of the same day, then asks identity.distinguish again against
the documents either side on other days. Navy Federal, Costco and PayPal
hand delivery those either side when there are none of the same day, so
no check of theirs is the plain check of the day where a rival exists,
since that refuses a document for not printing its day in a form the
check knows, and both of the first two destroy what is refused.

An app is found here by what it does, handing rivals to a check, never by
its name. One whose identities carry a single fact cannot pool two kinds,
since every rival differs from it by that fact or by nothing, and that is
read from its code. Every other app's pools are built here by its own
code, from rows of two accounts billed on shared days or their like, and
each pool handed to one check must keep a fact that tells every rival in
it apart. A fact a rival does not carry at all does not count, since
nothing compared it. It needs no browser and no account.
